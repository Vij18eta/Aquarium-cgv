🐠 AQUARIUM – OpenGL Mini Project (CGV)
🎨 Overview

AQUARIUM is a Computer Graphics and Visualization (CGV) mini project developed in C language using OpenGL.
The project simulates an underwater aquarium scene featuring animated fish, bubbles, and natural water movement.
It demonstrates fundamental and advanced concepts of OpenGL animations, transformations, and 2D/3D rendering.

💡 Features

🐟 Animated Fish swimming smoothly across the screen

💧 Rising Bubbles for a realistic underwater effect

🌊 Static Background simulating an aquarium environment

🌈 Colorful Environment with multiple fish of different colors and speeds

🎮 User Interaction (optional) — control animation speed or pause/resume

💻 Cross-platform compatibility (runs on Windows, Linux, and macOS)

⚙️ Technologies Used

Language: C

Graphics Library: OpenGL (GLUT)

IDE/Compiler: Code::Blocks / Dev-C++ / Visual Studio / GCC

Operating System: Windows / Ubuntu

🚀 How to Run

Install OpenGL and GLUT libraries in your IDE or system.

Clone or download the project:

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/AQUARIUM.git


Compile and run the program:

gcc aquarium.c -lGL -lGLU -lglut -lm -o aquarium
./aquarium


Enjoy watching your virtual aquarium come to life! 🌊🐠
